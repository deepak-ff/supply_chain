**Not a developer?** → [Executive Summary](EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md) — what this does and why it matters, no CLI or code.

---

## What It Is

ChainWarden is a supply chain security platform that works at three levels:

| Level | What you get |
|---|---|
| **CLI** (`cwctl`) | Scan any project in 2 commands. Works offline. No account needed. |
| **Dashboard** | Web UI with full 8-engine scan, file upload, live agent feed, alerts, allowlist |
| **API** | 42 REST endpoints — scan, SBOM, sign, advisory, allowlist, alerts, SSE stream |

One tool. 9 ecosystems. AI triage. Community signatures. SLSA Level 3 provenance.

---

## Quick Install

```bash
# One-line install (Linux / macOS / WSL) — no Go required
curl -sSfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/deepak-ff/supply_chain/main/install.sh | bash

# Go install (requires Go 1.25+)
go install github.com/deepak-ff/supply_chain/cmd/cwctl@latest

# Build from source
git clone https://github.com/deepak-ff/supply_chain.git
cd ChainWarden && make build   # → bin/cwctl  bin/cw-agent  bin/intel-agent
```

---

## 60-Second Quickstart

```bash
cwctl doctor --fix                       # validate + auto-repair environment
cwctl intel update                       # pull community detection signatures
cwctl scan .                             # scan every manifest in current project
cwctl scan npm/lodash@4.17.20            # scan a specific registry package
cwctl advisory npm/lodash@4.17.20        # AI-powered security advisory
cwctl patch . --dry-run                  # preview AI-proposed dependency upgrades
```

No config file. No account. First three commands need zero API keys.

**Sample output** (`cwctl scan .`):
```
axios@1.3.4  [grade F · 19 findings]
├─ CRITICAL  CVE-2023-45857  Header Injection   → fix: >= 1.12.0
├─ HIGH      CVE-2022-1214   SSRF               → fix: >= 1.7.4
└─ +17 more  (use --verbose to expand)

Completed in 3.2s  •  3 packages  •  Loaded: 24 signatures • 8 engines
```

## Free vs Pro

ChainWarden is **open-core** — the engine, CLI, scanner, and community tools are Apache 2.0, free forever. Pro adds AI-powered features and team capabilities.

| Feature | Community (Free) | Pro |
|---|---|---|
| `cwctl scan .` — local project scan | ✅ | ✅ |
| 8 scan engines (OSV + Behavioral + Malware + AI Model + MCP) | ✅ | ✅ |
| SBOM generation (CycloneDX + SPDX) | ✅ | ✅ |
| Sigstore keyless signing + verification | ✅ | ✅ |
| Community signatures (contribute + use) | ✅ | ✅ |
| `cwctl intel new/validate/test/update` | ✅ | ✅ |
| Policy-as-code enforcement | ✅ | ✅ |
| Self-hostable + airgap-compatible | ✅ | ✅ |
| Basic dashboard | ✅ | ✅ |
| Dashboard: allowlist, advisory, monitor, alerts, agents (patch feed), projects, webhooks | ✅ | ✅ |
| `cwctl advisory` / `cwctl patch` / `cwctl monitor` — AI features via CLI | 🔒 needs `CW_LICENSE_KEY` | ✅ |
| The same 3 features via the dashboard/API (needs AI provider API key) | ✅ | ✅ |
| Team management + RBAC | — | ✅ |
| SLA + priority support | — | ✅ |
| Cloud-hosted option | — | ✅ |

> **Why open-core?** The engine stays free, community signatures stay community-owned, revenue from Pro funds continued development. You'll never lose access to what you have today.

---

## The 8 Scan Engines

Every `cwctl scan` and dashboard scan runs all available engines concurrently:

```
OSV          → Known CVEs via osv.dev API          (always runs)
Behavioral   → Malicious install scripts, typosquatting (always runs)
Malware      → Byte/regex pattern matching          (always runs)
AI Model     → HuggingFace weight safety            (always runs)
MCP          → Prompt injection in tool descriptions (always runs)
Grype        → Deep CVE scan of artifact files      (if installed)
Trivy        → Container + OS CVE scanning          (if installed)
Semgrep      → SAST static analysis                 (if installed)
```

Dashboard scan shows per-engine status: ✓ ran / ✗ skipped (with reason).

---

## Dashboard

```bash
make up                        # start minimal stack: postgres + redis + API on :8080
make dashboard-dev              # dashboard dev server on :3000, proxies /api/ to :8080
open http://localhost:8080
```

## Community Signatures — Nuclei-style Contribution

ChainWarden uses a community detection library. Contributing takes **10 minutes**:

```bash
# 1. Create a signature with the interactive wizard
cwctl intel new

# 2. Validate schema + regex
cwctl intel validate ./CW-npm-my-sig.yaml

# 3. Test against a real package
cwctl intel test ./CW-npm-my-sig.yaml \
  --ecosystem=npm --package=evil-package --version=1.0.0

# 4. Fork → place in signatures/ → open PR
# CI auto-validates. Maintainer reviews logic only.
```

**24 signatures included** — loaded automatically from this repo's `signatures/` directory when you run `cwctl` from inside a git clone (no setup needed). `cwctl update` pulls newer community signatures once they're published to [chainwarden-signatures](https://github.com/deepak-ff/supply_chain):
```bash
cwctl update
cwctl intel list --type=malware_pattern
```

| Type | What it catches | Count |
|---|---|---|
| `blocklisted_package` | Confirmed malicious (event-stream, XZ utils, polyfill.io…) | 9 |
| `typosquatting_target` | Popular packages + variant names (lodash×15, react×17, requests×16) | 3 |
| `behavioral_rule` | Postinstall env harvest, SSH key theft, dep confusion, setup.py exec | 4 |
| `malware_pattern` | base64-eval, discord token, ELF dropper, CI secret exfil | 4 |
| `mcp_injection_pattern` | Tool shadowing, data exfil via output | 2 |
| `pickle_rule` | Unsafe AI model configs, missing model cards | 2 |

Two auth models, independent of each other:
- **CLI/API clients**: `X-Api-Key: <key>` or `Authorization: Bearer <key>`. Set `CW_API_KEY` env var. Empty = dev mode (no auth).
- **Dashboard login**: session cookie via `/api/v1/auth/login`, enabled by setting `CW_ADMIN_EMAIL` + `CW_ADMIN_PASSWORD` + `CW_SESSION_SECRET` on the API server.

## Policy-as-Code

```yaml
# ~/.chainwarden/policy.yaml
version: 1
fail_on: high
deny_packages:
  - event-stream
  - requests-dmarc
block_typosquatting: true
require_signing: false
```

```bash
cwctl policy check        # evaluate current project against policy
cwctl policy show         # display active policy
cwctl policy set deny=lodash@4.17.20   # add package to blocklist
```

---

## Risk Score

Every package gets a letter grade (A–F) from a composite score:

| Factor | Weight | Signal |
|---|---|---|
| Vulnerability | 0–40 | CVE severity distribution |
| Behavioral | 0–30 | Malware / install script signals |
| Supply Chain | 0–20 | Typosquatting / confusion |
| Maintenance | 0–10 | Abandonment / age |

| Grade | Score | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| A | 0–20 | Clean |
| B | 21–40 | Low risk |
| C | 41–60 | Review recommended |
| D | 61–80 | High risk — upgrade |
| F | 81–100 | Critical — block |

---

## Full Platform (Team / Enterprise)

```bash
make up            # full dev stack
make up-minimal    # API + DB only
make up-enterprise # + Dependency-Track + Rekor
```

Includes: PostgreSQL, Redis, MinIO, Rekor, Prometheus, Grafana, API, Worker, Dashboard, Intel-Agent CronJob.

**Production deployment** (AWS):
```
